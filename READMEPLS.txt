What I changed, and what I'm ???(thinking) about lol

basically the devOps metrics i made a new class called devOps.py to change the devops metrics all from there.
??? thinking if we wanna add a graph how do we keep the data... json?

the only variable that is used throughout is featureSelected, which is the features selected.

??? thinking which devOps to metrics to use to calculate the error...

other than that, goodluck reading my code :)))
