What I changed, and what I'm ???(thinking) about lol

basically the devOps metrics i made a new class called devOps.py to change the devops metrics all from there.
??? thinking if we wanna add a graph how do we keep the data... json?

the only variable that is used throughout is featureSelected, which is the features selected.

changed the error_message to customer_feedback

??? thinking which devOps to metrics to use to calculate the error...

other than that, goodluck reading my code :)))
